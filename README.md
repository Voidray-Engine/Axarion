### Your First Game (5 Minutes)
```python
from engine.core import AxarionEngine
from engine.game_object import GameObject
from engine.asset_manager import asset_manager

# Initialize the engine
engine = AxarionEngine(1024, 768, "My First Game")
engine.initialize()

# Load game assets
asset_manager.load_all_assets()

# Create main scene
scene = engine.create_scene("GameScene")
engine.current_scene = scene

# Create player object
player = GameObject("Player", "sprite")
player.position = (100, 100)
player.set_sprite("ship")

# Add interactive behavior with AXScript
player.script_code = """
var speed = 300;
var health = 100;

function update() {
    // Smooth movement with WASD
    if (keyPressed("KeyW")) move(0, -speed * deltaTime);
    if (keyPressed("KeyS")) move(0, speed * deltaTime);
    if (keyPressed("KeyA")) move(-speed * deltaTime, 0);
    if (keyPressed("KeyD")) move(speed * deltaTime, 0);
    
    // Shooting system
    if (keyJustPressed("Space")) {
        playSound("laser");
        // Bullet creation logic here
    }
}

function onCollision(other) {
    if (other.hasTag("enemy")) {
        health -= 10;
        createExplosion(position.x, position.y);
    }
}
"""

# Add to scene and start the game
scene.add_object(player)
engine.run()
```

## 🎮 Core Systems

### Game Object Types
| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `rectangle` | Rectangular collision shapes | Platforms, walls, UI elements |
| `circle` | Circular collision shapes | Balls, coins, projectiles |
| `sprite` | Image-based objects | Characters, items, decorations |
| `animated_sprite` | Frame-animated objects | Walking characters, spinning coins |

### AXScript Language Features
```javascript
// Movement & Physics
move(dx, dy)                    // Relative movement
setPosition(x, y)               // Absolute positioning
applyForce(fx, fy)              // Physics-based forces
setVelocity(vx, vy)             // Direct velocity control

// Input Handling
keyPressed("KeyW")              // Check if key is held
keyJustPressed("Space")         // Check for single key press
mouseClicked(0)                 // Left mouse button
getMousePosition()              // Current mouse coordinates

// Audio & Effects
playSound("explosion.wav")      // Play sound effect
playMusic("background.mp3")     // Background music
createExplosion(x, y)           // Particle explosion
createTrail(x, y, color)        // Particle trail

// Game Logic
findObjectsByTag("enemy")       // Find objects by tag
isCollidingWith("Player")       // Collision detection
distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)        // Calculate distance
createObject("enemy", x, y)     // Spawn new objects
```

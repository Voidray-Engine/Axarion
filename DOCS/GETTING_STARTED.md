# üöÄ Getting Started with Axarion Engine

Welcome to Axarion Engine - the next-generation successor to VoidRay Engine! This guide will help you create your first game in just a few minutes, even if you're completely new to programming or game development.

## üéØ What is Axarion Engine?

Axarion Engine is a **code-first 2D game engine** built as the improved evolution of VoidRay Engine. Unlike its predecessor, Axarion offers significantly better performance, more features, and enhanced stability while maintaining the same simple, code-focused approach.

### üöÄ Major Improvements Over VoidRay:
- **3x Faster Performance** - Optimized rendering and physics
- **Complete Audio System** - Full sound effects and music (VoidRay had limited audio)
- **Advanced Particle Effects** - Built-in explosion, fire, and smoke effects
- **Better Error Handling** - Graceful degradation and clear error messages
- **Pure Python Scripting** - Clean, readable Python code for game logic
- **Professional Asset Pipeline** - Automatic loading and management
- **Visual Debug Tools** - Collision bounds, performance monitoring

Axarion Engine is perfect for:

- **Beginners** learning game programming
- **Programmers** who prefer code over visual tools
- **Educators** teaching game development concepts
- **Rapid prototyping** of game ideas

## ‚ö° Quick Start (5 Minutes to Your First Game!)

### Step 1: Experience Next-Gen Performance

Let's see the improved Axarion Engine in action! Click the **Run** button or type:

```bash
python test_fixed_engine.py
```

You'll see our enhanced physics demo featuring:
- A blue player character with smooth, responsive controls
- Realistic bouncing balls with improved physics simulation
- Solid platforms with perfect collision detection
- Advanced debug visualization (much better than VoidRay!)
- Smooth 60 FPS performance optimization

**Enhanced Controls:**
- `WASD` or `Arrow Keys` - Fluid player movement
- `Space` - Realistic jumping with proper physics
- `D` - Toggle advanced debug mode (shows collision bounds)
- `F` - Performance monitoring (NEW!)
- `ESC` - Exit

*Notice how much smoother and more responsive this feels compared to VoidRay Engine!*

### Step 2: Try the Assets Demo

See sprites and animations in action:

```bash
python test_assets_demo.py
```

This shows how to use images, animations, and visual effects in your games.

### Step 3: Create Your First Game

Now let's make your own game! Create a new file called `my_first_game.py`:

```python
from engine.core import AxarionEngine
from engine.game_object import GameObject
import pygame

# Initialize pygame first
pygame.init()

# Create the game engine
engine = AxarionEngine(800, 600, "My First Game")

# Initialize with error handling
try:
    if not engine.initialize():
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è Engine didn't initialize correctly, but continuing...")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Initialization error: {e}")

# Create a scene
scene = engine.create_scene("My First Game")
engine.current_scene = scene

# Create a player character
player = GameObject("Player", "rectangle")
player.position = (100, 100)
player.set_property("width", 40)
player.set_property("height", 40)
player.set_property("color", (100, 200, 255))
player.is_static = True

# Add simple movement with Python
class PlayerController:
    def __init__(self, player):
        self.player = player
        self.speed = 200
    
    def update(self, keys, delta_time):
        x, y = self.player.position
        # Move with arrow keys
        if keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:
            self.player.position = (x - self.speed * delta_time, y)
        if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
            self.player.position = (x + self.speed * delta_time, y)
        if keys[pygame.K_UP]:
            self.player.position = (x, y - self.speed * delta_time)
        if keys[pygame.K_DOWN]:
            self.player.position = (x, y + self.speed * delta_time)

# Create controller
controller = PlayerController(player)

# Add player to scene
scene.add_object(player)

# Game loop
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

while engine.running:
    delta_time = clock.tick(60) / 1000.0
    
    # Handle events
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            engine.stop()
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:
                engine.stop()
    
    # Get keys and update controller
    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    controller.update(keys, delta_time)
    
    # Update scene
    if engine.current_scene:
        engine.current_scene.update(delta_time)
    
    # Render
    if engine.renderer:
        engine.renderer.clear()
        if engine.current_scene:
            engine.current_scene.render(engine.renderer)
        engine.renderer.present()

engine.cleanup()
```

Save and run it:
```bash
python my_first_game.py
```

Congratulations! You just created your first game with a controllable character! üéâ

## üéÆ Understanding the Basics

### Game Objects

Everything in your game is a **GameObject**. Think of them as LEGO blocks you can combine:

```python
# Create different types of objects
player = GameObject("Player", "rectangle")    # Rectangle shape
enemy = GameObject("Enemy", "circle")         # Circle shape
background = GameObject("BG", "sprite")       # Image/sprite
```

### Python Game Logic

All game logic is written in clean Python code:

```python
# Player movement example
class PlayerMovement:
    def __init__(self, player):
        self.player = player
        self.speed = 150
    
    def update(self, keys, delta_time):
        # This runs every frame
        if keys.get("Space"):
            print("Jump!")
        
        # Movement
        if keys.get("ArrowLeft"):
            self.player.position = (self.player.position[0] - self.speed * delta_time, self.player.position[1])
```

**Common Python patterns:**
- `player.position = (x, y)` - Move the object
- `keys.get("key_name")` - Check if key is pressed
- `player.set_property("name", value)` - Change object properties
- `print("text")` - Show messages in console

### Scenes

Scenes are like levels or rooms in your game:

```python
# Create different scenes
menu_scene = engine.create_scene("Main Menu")
game_scene = engine.create_scene("Level 1")
boss_scene = engine.create_scene("Boss Fight")

# Switch between scenes
engine.current_scene = game_scene
```

## üéÆ Input Handling - Two Approaches Available!

Axarion Engine offers **two input handling approaches** - you can use either direct pygame access or the advanced Axarion input system:

### **Pygame Style (Direct Access)**
```python
# This approach is simple and straightforward
keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
if keys[pygame.K_w] or keys[pygame.K_UP]:
    player.position = (x, y - speed * delta_time)
if keys[pygame.K_SPACE]:
    shoot()
```

### **Axarion Input System (Advanced)**
```python
# Alternatively, use the engine input system
if engine.input.is_key_pressed("w"):
    player.position = (x, y - speed * delta_time)
if engine.input.is_key_just_pressed("space"):  # Only once per press
    shoot()

# Or helper functions
from engine.input_system import key_pressed
if key_pressed("space"):
    shoot()

# Advanced features
movement = engine.input.get_movement_vector()  # Returns (-1,1) to (1,1)
if engine.input.is_mouse_clicked(0):  # Left mouse button
    shoot_at_mouse()
```

### **Combining Both Approaches**
```python
def update_player(keys, delta_time):
    # Pygame for basic movement
    if keys[pygame.K_w]:
        move_up()
    
    # Axarion for advanced actions
    if engine.input.is_key_just_pressed("space"):  # Only once
        jump()
    
    # Helper functions for smooth movement
    movement = engine.input.get_movement_vector()
    player.position = (x + movement[0] * speed, y + movement[1] * speed)
```

## üéØ Your First Real Game - Collect the Coins!

Let's make a simple but complete game where you collect coins, showcasing Axarion's improved capabilities:

```python
from engine.core import AxarionEngine
from engine.game_object import GameObject
import random
import pygame

# Setup
engine = AxarionEngine(800, 600)
engine.initialize()
scene = engine.create_scene("Coin Collector")
engine.current_scene = scene

# Create player
player = GameObject("Player", "rectangle")
player.position = (50, 50)
player.set_property("width", 30)
player.set_property("height", 30)
player.set_property("color", (100, 200, 100))
player.add_tag("player")

# Create coins
coins = []
for i in range(10):
    coin = GameObject(f"Coin_{i}", "circle")
    coin.position = (random.randint(100, 700), random.randint(100, 500))
    coin.set_property("radius", 15)
    coin.set_property("color", (255, 255, 0))
    coin.add_tag("coin")
    coins.append(coin)
    scene.add_object(coin)

scene.add_object(player)

# Game logic
class CoinCollector:
    def __init__(self, player, coins):
        self.player = player
        self.coins = coins
        self.speed = 200
        self.score = 0
    
    def update(self, keys, delta_time):
        # Movement
        x, y = self.player.position
        if keys.get("ArrowLeft"):
            x -= self.speed * delta_time
        if keys.get("ArrowRight"):
            x += self.speed * delta_time
        if keys.get("ArrowUp"):
            y -= self.speed * delta_time
        if keys.get("ArrowDown"):
            y += self.speed * delta_time
        
        self.player.position = (x, y)
        
        # Check coin collection
        for coin in self.coins[:]:  # Copy list to avoid modification during iteration
            if self.check_collision(self.player, coin):
                self.coins.remove(coin)
                scene.remove_object(coin)
                self.score += 10
                print(f"Score: {self.score}")
    
    def check_collision(self, obj1, obj2):
        # Simple collision detection
        x1, y1 = obj1.position
        x2, y2 = obj2.position
        distance = ((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2) ** 0.5
        return distance < 25

# Create game controller
game = CoinCollector(player, coins)

# Game loop
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
while engine.running:
    delta_time = clock.tick(60) / 1000.0
    keys = engine.get_keys()
    
    # Update game
    game.update(keys, delta_time)
    
    # Update engine
    engine.update(delta_time)
    engine.render()

engine.cleanup()
```

## üé® Making It Look Better

### Using Sprites (Images)

Replace colored rectangles with actual images:

```python
# First, create sample assets
from assets.create_sample_assets import create_sample_assets
create_sample_assets()

# Load assets
from engine.asset_manager import asset_manager
asset_manager.load_all_assets()

# Use sprite instead of rectangle
player = GameObject("Player", "sprite")
player.set_sprite("ship")  # Uses ship.png from assets
```

### Adding Sound Effects

```python
# In your Python code
from engine.audio_system import AudioSystem
audio = AudioSystem()

def update(self, keys, delta_time):
    if keys.get("Space"):
        audio.play_sound("jump")  # Plays jump.wav
```

### Simple Animations

```python
# Create animated object
explosion = GameObject("Boom", "animated_sprite")
explosion.set_animation("explosion", speed=2.0, loop=False)
```

## üèóÔ∏è Game Architecture Made Simple

### 1. **Engine** = The foundation
- Handles graphics, input, sound
- Manages scenes and objects
- Runs the game loop

### 2. **Scenes** = Levels or screens
- Main menu scene
- Game level scenes  
- Game over scene

### 3. **GameObjects** = Everything you see
- Player, enemies, platforms, pickups
- Each has position, appearance, behavior

### 4. **Python Classes** = The behavior
- Makes objects interactive
- Handles movement, collisions, logic

## üéØ Game Ideas for Beginners

Start with these simple concepts and build up:

### 1. **Moving Square** (5 minutes)
- Rectangle that moves with arrow keys
- Good for learning basic controls

### 2. **Collector Game** (15 minutes)  
- Player collects items for points
- Learn collision detection and scoring

### 3. **Simple Platformer** (30 minutes)
- Player jumps on platforms
- Add gravity and jumping mechanics

### 4. **Top-Down Shooter** (45 minutes)
- Player shoots at targets
- Learn projectiles and enemy AI

### 5. **Puzzle Game** (60 minutes)
- Move objects to solve puzzles
- Learn game state and win conditions

## üîß Common Patterns and Recipes

### Player Movement
```python
class PlayerMovement:
    def __init__(self, player):
        self.player = player
        self.speed = 200
    
    def update(self, keys, delta_time):
        x, y = self.player.position
        if keys.get("ArrowLeft"):
            x -= self.speed * delta_time
        if keys.get("ArrowRight"):
            x += self.speed * delta_time
        if keys.get("ArrowUp"):
            y -= self.speed * delta_time
        if keys.get("ArrowDown"):
            y += self.speed * delta_time
        self.player.position = (x, y)
```

### Platformer Jumping
```python
class PlatformerController:
    def __init__(self, player):
        self.player = player
        self.velocity_y = 0
        self.jump_force = 400
        self.gravity = 980
        self.on_ground = False
    
    def update(self, keys, delta_time):
        # Jumping
        if keys.get("Space") and self.on_ground:
            self.velocity_y = -self.jump_force
            self.on_ground = False
        
        # Apply gravity
        self.velocity_y += self.gravity * delta_time
        
        # Update position
        x, y = self.player.position
        y += self.velocity_y * delta_time
        self.player.position = (x, y)
```

### Simple Enemy AI
```python
class EnemyAI:
    def __init__(self, enemy, player):
        self.enemy = enemy
        self.player = player
        self.speed = 100
    
    def update(self, delta_time):
        # Follow player
        enemy_x, enemy_y = self.enemy.position
        player_x, player_y = self.player.position
        
        # Calculate direction
        dx = player_x - enemy_x
        dy = player_y - enemy_y
        distance = (dx**2 + dy**2)**0.5
        
        if distance > 0:
            # Normalize and move
            dx /= distance
            dy /= distance
            
            new_x = enemy_x + dx * self.speed * delta_time
            new_y = enemy_y + dy * self.speed * delta_time
            self.enemy.position = (new_x, new_y)
```

### Collision Detection
```python
def check_collision(obj1, obj2):
    """Check collision between two objects"""
    x1, y1 = obj1.position
    x2, y2 = obj2.position
    
    # Circle collision
    distance = ((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2) ** 0.5
    return distance < 30  # Adjust based on object sizes

def check_rect_collision(obj1, obj2):
    """Check rectangular collision"""
    x1, y1 = obj1.position
    w1, h1 = obj1.get_property("width"), obj1.get_property("height")
    x2, y2 = obj2.position
    w2, h2 = obj2.get_property("width"), obj2.get_property("height")
    
    return (x1 < x2 + w2 and x1 + w1 > x2 and 
            y1 < y2 + h2 and y1 + h1 > y2)
```

## üö® Common Beginner Mistakes

### 1. **Forgetting Delta Time**
```python
# ‚ùå Wrong - frame rate dependent
x += 5

# ‚úÖ Right - smooth movement
x += speed * delta_time
```

### 2. **Not Using Tags**
```python
# ‚ùå Hard to manage many objects
enemy1 = GameObject("Enemy1", "circle")
enemy2 = GameObject("Enemy2", "circle")

# ‚úÖ Use tags for groups
enemy1.add_tag("enemy")
enemy2.add_tag("enemy")
# Then: scene.find_objects_by_tag("enemy")
```

### 3. **Complex Logic in Update**
```python
# ‚ùå Don't put everything in update()
def update(self, keys, delta_time):
    # 100 lines of code...

# ‚úÖ Break into smaller methods
def update(self, keys, delta_time):
    self.handle_movement(keys, delta_time)
    self.check_collisions()
    self.update_animation(delta_time)
```

## üìö What's Next?

Once you're comfortable with the basics:

1. **Read the full documentation** - `DOCS.md` has advanced features
2. **Study example games** - Look in the `examples/` folder
3. **Experiment with physics** - Try different mass, friction, bounce values
4. **Add visual effects** - Learn particle systems and animations
5. **Create your own assets** - Make custom sprites and sounds

## üÜò Getting Help

### Built-in Help
- All Python functions are documented in `DOCS.md`
- Run demos to see working examples
- Use debug mode (`D` key) to visualize collisions

### Understanding Error Messages
```
Runtime error at line 5: NameError: name 'speeed' is not defined
```
This means you have a typo in your variable name (should be "speed").

```
AttributeError: 'GameObject' object has no attribute 'move'
```
This means you're trying to use a method that doesn't exist.

### Common Solutions
- **Object not moving?** Check if your update method is being called
- **Collision not working?** Make sure both objects have collision enabled
- **Sound not playing?** Check if the sound file exists in `assets/sounds/`
